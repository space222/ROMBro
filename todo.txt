ROMBro Todo List
-------------------

Since both original and color gameboy emulation is nearly done
(minus sound and various accuracy improvements), tasks are no longer
numbered.

- there's still ppu features unimplemented (HBlank IRQ, CGB background/OAM priority. etc)
- Sound
- controller/joystick input
- Serial comms over internet?

Bugs:

- Figure out why super mario deluxe has wrong and missing background tiles and sprites.
- Pokemon Trading Card game doesn't run at all
