ROMBro Todo List
-------------------

Since both original and color gameboy emulation is nearly done
(minus sound and various accuracy improvements), tasks are no longer
numbered.

- there's still problems that range from minor graphical glitches to games that don't run at all
- Sound
- controller/joystick input
- Serial comms over internet?

Bugs:

- Figure out why super mario deluxe has "shifted" graphics on copyright screen, and wrong attributes for pipes.
- Pokemon Trading Card game doesn't run at all
- Pokemon Crystal misses the eye dot on the running creature on the title screen
