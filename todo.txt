ROMBro Todo List
-------------------

There's not many more essential items to having full(ish) [original] gameboy emulation,
so there are now non-numbered tasks:

- Sound
- Only load bootrom after the type (orig. or color) of rom is known.
- More and better MBC support (RAM enable/disable, RTC regs, etc)

After that, there's just the Color features.
