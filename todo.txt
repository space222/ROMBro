ROMBro Todo List
-------------------

There's not many more essential items to having full(ish) [original] gameboy emulation,
so there are now non-numbered tasks:

- Sound
- There's definitely still display bugs (PokemonRed title screen, sprites disappear too far down the screen, etc)
- More and better MBC support (RAM enable/disable, RTC regs, etc)


After that, there's just the Color features.
