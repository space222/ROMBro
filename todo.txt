ROMBro Todo List
-------------------

Since both original and color gameboy emulation is nearly done
(minus various accuracy improvements), tasks are no longer
numbered.

- there's still problems with attributes (and possibly bg tiles themselves) in some color games
- Improve sound 
	^- either length or envelope is buggy, sq1 sweep is likely wrong, 
	 - and no idea what's going on with noise
- controller/joystick input
	^- started it, but haven't got around to finding a usb cable
- Serial comms over internet?
	^- probably not hard to hack something together, but low priority.
	
Bugs:

- Figure out why super mario deluxe has "shifted" graphics on copyright screen, and wrong attributes for pipes.
- Pokemon Crystal misses the eye dot on the running creature on the title screen


Solved bugs:

- Pokemon Trading Card game depends on reading the color palette, or gets stuck writing to it.
